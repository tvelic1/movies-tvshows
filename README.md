## Available Scripts
Make sure that you are in right folder (movies-tvshows), then type "npm install" to install dependencies.
I pushed ".env-example" file, you can get your API key on MoviesDB. After that you should rename file to ".env", and paste the API key.
Additionally you can paste it directly at ./fetchData/api.ts 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Possibly that will happen automatically.</br>
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
After you type "npm test", probably you will have to type "a" to run all test, but you will see instructions.
